Consulting for a Hospital as Data Scientist to build
a machine-learning model that can predict the
likelihood of a person having a heart disease
based on the given features.

age = age in years

sex = (1= male; 0 = female)

chest pain type (cp) (1:typical angina, 2: atypical angina, 3: non-anginal pain, 4: asymptomatic)

resting blood pressure(trestbps) (in mm hg on admission to the hospital),

serum cholesterol (chol), (in mg/dl)

fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (fbs), (1 = True, 0 = False)

resting electrocardiographic results (restecg),

maximum heart rate achieved (thalach),

exercise-inducedangina (exang), (1=yes, 0= No)

ST depression induced by exercise relativeto rest (oldpeak),

The slope of the peak exercise ST segment(slope),

number of major vessels colored by flourosopy(ca),(0-3)

thalassemia (thal)(thal-3 = normal, 6 = fixed defect, 7 = reversable defect)

Target - Heart disease or not (1=yes, 0= no)
